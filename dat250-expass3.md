### Expass 3
#### Technical Problems Encountered

Several issues arose due to my backend not being entirely correct. When I started working on the frontend, I noticed several small errors that I needed to fix. Additionally, I automated the code to reduce the amount of manual data entry required for each part of the code. This took some time but improved the overall process.

There were also some issues with setting up Svelte and determining where things should be placed within the existing code, as well as what could be removed.

#### Pending Issues

I did not fully understand "Step 5: Deploy," but I believe it might be in order now. There is also a minor issue with the `VoteComponent` class and how it interacts with the `PollComponent` class. I did not have time to resolve everything. There is a minor bug where I cannot always load the polls correctly.
