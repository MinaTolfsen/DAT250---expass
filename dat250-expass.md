## Expass 2

### Technical problems encountered during installation and how they were resolved

I did not face any major issues during the installation process while working on the expass2 exercise. However, I found it somewhat challenging to understand how to continue working on the same project while managing separate repositories in GitHub. Specifically, I needed to save expass1 in its own repository and then continue working on the same code for expass2, but in a new repository. I received help from former students to get familiar with this process, which broadened my understanding. I also created a checklist to make it easier for me to repeat these steps for future exercises.

### Pending issues with this assignment that you were unable to solve

I wasn’t able to finish all the tests. Most of them are running in a `PollAppIntegrationTest.java` file. I also tried to create HTTP tests but struggled to structure them correctly, although the foundational structure is in place. I downloaded Postman to verify that the code was functioning as expected, which turned out to be an incredibly useful tool.

In terms of the code, I should have implemented a feature to count how many votes a poll received. I also noticed that when user1 voted, it overwrote user2's vote, which is something I would have liked to fix but didn’t have enough time. Additionally, I wanted to implement a way to track which `VoteOption` received the most votes.
